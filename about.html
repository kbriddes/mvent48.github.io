            <h2>About the Universe</h2>
            <p>In the expansive galaxy of Yermon, you are awoken by an unknown entity that speaks to you from the outer reaches of reality.
            You're ship flickers on and off as you float about the cabin wondering what had happened to you. Then, a timer appears at the center of your heads up display.
            24 hours. A prompt at your main ordinance at the front of your ship screeches alive telling you the center of the galaxy is where I must go to find answers.
            The center of the galaxy is where riches beyond any lifeforms wildest dreams await. That's when a huge fighter class ship streaks past you rumbling the shambles of your ship.
            Your radio comms spark alive and you hear the passing ship's captain barking to you to get to the center, and that it is the only way.
            Your story has begun.</p>
