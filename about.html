            <h2>About the Universe</h2>
            <p>In the expansive galaxy of Yermon, you are awoken by an unknown entity that speaks to you from the outer reaches of reality.
            Your ship flickers on and off as you float about the cabin wondering what had happened to you. Then, a timer appears at the center of your heads up display.
            24 hours. A prompt at your main ordinance at the front of your ship screeches alive telling you the center of the galaxy is where I must go to find answers.
            The center of the galaxy is where riches beyond any lifeforms wildest dreams await. That's when a huge fighter class ship streaks past you rumbling the shambles of your ship.
            Your radio comms spark alive and you hear the passing ship's captain barking to you to get to the center, and that it is the only way.
            Your story has begun.</p>

            <h2>Preview of What to Expect</h2>
            <p>Space Race pits thousands of players in an expansive sandbox galaxy together to race to the center over 24 real-time hours.
            If your 24 hours expires then you are reset to you outer rims of the galaxy in which you must restart your journey. This game
            focuses on endurance and all about teamwork (or possibly betrayal) to make your way to the center of the galaxy. This game is an FPS RPG that
            requires players to make decisions on traveling about the galaxy and upgrading their ship to best help through the harsh environment of space.
            You will start out with a multitool that will be used to make repairs to your ship as well as vanquish any intrusive enemies.
            Become a trade merchant and work your way through separate star systems to slowly build up your ship to increase your chances of survival on your way to the center.
            Become a violent mercenary who steals the best parts to build up your ship to become a behemoth of a destroyer. There are many paths one could take
            as they race their way to the center of the galaxy.</p>
